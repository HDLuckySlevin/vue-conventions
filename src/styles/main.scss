/*
  Even if we build vue apps, we still have styles that are used globally throughout the whole application. These could be things like
  css reset, flexbox or spacing helper classes, column grid templates and so on. These styles should not live inside components, because
  they extend them. The main.scss file is the main source file from where we load all the styles together.
  We have to find a good order in which we load the files.

  We don't have to load stuff from the abstracts folder, because these styles are loaded via webpack.

  First we load the base styles. This should be stuff like css reset and base styles
